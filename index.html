    <p>A First-round loss for Mexico`s Karla Hinojosa, who qualified 30th on the ranking round, came at the hand of <i>Kyrgyzstan`s</i> Asel Shaerbekova.
    She shot in Copenhagen and Antalya in 2015 but, prior to that, hadn`t been seen internationally since the qualifier ahead of London 2012.
    Asel`s first round match in Shanghai, and upset of Hinojosa, was also her first win on the world senior international stage. Nice!</p>
